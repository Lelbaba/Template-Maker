You need python for this. Script.py will generate a tex file 'out.tex' which will be the latex source code for the template.
Running out.tex with pdflatex should produce the template pdf.

1. Insert All Codes into some folder in the 'Codes\' directory
2. There can be nested subdirectories upto three layers
3. run script.py by "python script.py"
4. out.tex should have desired output (tex source)

ALternatively if you have pdflatex installed then you can just run exec.bat
